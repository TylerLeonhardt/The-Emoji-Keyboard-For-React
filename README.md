# THE EMOJI KEYBOARD

Let's face it. We all love emojis. However, we often miss out on using them on our laptops and desktops. Not anymore! Now you can add an Emoji Keyboard to your React project with The Emoji Keyboard!

## Getting Started

To check out the demo follow these steps:

1. simply download this zip or clone the repo.
2. Do a `bower install` to install the dependencies (which is just React and Babel)
3. Host the index.html file with your favorite method (Like: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9876`)
4. Navigate to `localhost:9876` in a browser.
5. Enjoy!
